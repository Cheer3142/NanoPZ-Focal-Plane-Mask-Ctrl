Focal Plane Mask Control Procedure

This is mini project from EvWaCo Prototype team at Narit. The main purpose of this project is to Integrate the control of the nano-piezo actuator to the measured mask FWHM and create application that have fully access to the actuator. The electronic components that we use are 1 GigE camera from point grey and 1 actuator from the Newport. The final goal of this project is to adjust the FWHM by using close loop control.
